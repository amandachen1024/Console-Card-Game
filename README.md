# Console-Card-Game

This game was created to apply knowledge of object-oriented-programming for ICS4U (Grade 12 Computer Science / AP Computer Science Principles).

In this game, you play against the computer to gain the most points. Each round, both of you are randomly dealt 5 cards are given points based on the highest pokerhand you have (ie. 4 of a kind is worth 10, full house is worth 7, pair is worth 1, etc.). At the end of the round, you will know your score and the computer's score, and will have the option to play another round until the entire deck is dealt (or there are not enough cards to play another round). Then, a winner will be declared based on who has more points.
